# ISER Dataset Analysis Using Classical Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of the ISER dataset using classical machine learning models. The primary focus is on preparing the data, encoding text using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) method, training multiple machine learning models, and evaluating their performance to identify the best model for text classification tasks.

## 1. Data Preparation
- **Load the Dataset:** The ISER dataset is first loaded for processing.
- **Preprocessing:** Necessary steps are taken to handle any missing values or inconsistencies in the data.
- **Splitting the Dataset:** The data is divided into training and testing sets to ensure a fair evaluation of the models.

## 2. Bag-of-Words (BoW) Encoding
- **Text to Numerical Vectors:** Convert text data into numerical vectors using the Bag-of-Words methodology.
- **Tokenization and Vocabulary Creation:** Tokenize the text and create a vocabulary to keep track of word frequencies in the documents.

## 3. Model Training and Evaluation
- **Model Initialization:** Instances of classical machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression are initialized.
- **Training:** Each model is trained using the corresponding BoW representations of the training data.
- **Evaluation:** Models are evaluated using the testing data.
- **Performance Metrics:** Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Techniques like grid search or random search are used to optimize model performance.

## 4. Results Analysis
- **Model Comparison:** Compare the models based on various evaluation metrics.
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis:** Analyze the confusion matrix to understand classification performance across different classes.
- **Visualization:** Visual aids may be used to enhance understanding of the model's performance.

## 5. Conclusion
- **Summary of Findings:** Discuss the strengths and weaknesses observed in each model.
- **Insights and Improvements:** Offer insights into potential areas for improvement or further research.
- **Recommendations:** Conclude with recommendations for the best-performing model for the specific task at hand.

## Additional Considerations
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Address any class imbalance present in the dataset as it can significantly affect model performance.
- **Alternative Text Embeddings:** Consider testing other text embedding techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to compare their efficacy against BoW.
