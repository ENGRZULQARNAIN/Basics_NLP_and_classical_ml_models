1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load the ISER dataset.
   - Preprocess the dataset (if necessary) to handle any missing values or inconsistencies.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Bag-of-Words (BoW) Encoding**:
   - Convert the text data into numerical vectors using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach.
   - This involves tokenizing the text, creating a vocabulary, and counting the frequency of each word in the text documents.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Initialize instances of the classical machine learning models: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, and logistic regression.
   - Train each model using the training data and their corresponding BoW representations.
   - Evaluate the trained models using the testing data.
   - Calculate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the models' performance.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning for each model to optimize their performance. For example, you can use techniques like grid search or random search.

4. **Results Analysis**:
   - Compare the performance of different models based on the evaluation metrics.
   - Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance in classifying different classes.
   - Visualize the results if necessary to provide a clear understanding of the model's performance.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the findings and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
   - Provide insights into potential areas for improvement or further experimentation.
   - Conclude with recommendations for selecting the best-performing model for the given task.

Remember to handle class imbalances if present in the dataset, as it can affect the performance of the models. Additionally, you may consider incorporating other text embedding techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) for comparison with BoW.
